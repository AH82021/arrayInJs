A **Promise** is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. A promise can be in one of three states:

- **Pending**: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- **Fulfilled**: The operation completed successfully.
- **Rejected**: The operation failed.
